Wow!
I am finally up and running with github! This is an exciting development. 

Now on to ufc Gaethje vs Ferguson.

My thoughts are that Gaethje had the fight of his life.
This was able to cut through Ferguson's plan which is to chop, chop, tire, and wear down his opponents-without too much weight put into his defense. 
Unfortunately for Tony, he sustained too much damage to flip the tide on Gaethje, as he does with most opponents.
He did land some significant strikes and there was a point in time when Gaethje was gasping for air as Ferguson was fresh, but the continual punishment from the shots Gaethje landed eventually collapsed Ferguson. 

Now I would love to see Gaethje vs. Conor or Khabib.
